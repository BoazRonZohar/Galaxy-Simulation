# Galaxy Simulation

A physics-based simulation of a galaxy with interactive controls and adjustable parameters.

## Features

- Tunable parameters:
  - Gravitational constant
  - Central mass
  - Number of bodies per layer
  - Density per layer
  - Initial velocity
  - Epsilon (ε): minimum distance for gravitational calculation
  - Delta t (Δt): simulation time step

- Visual mass spectrum:
  - Blue = largest mass
  - Red = smallest mass

- Real-time interaction:
  - Start, pause, and restart
  - Add/remove bodies during simulation
  - Adjust density and return to settings

- Displays:
  - Angular momentum
  - Total kinetic energy
  - Total potential energy

## Purpose

This simulation illustrates the gravitational behavior of celestial systems, offering insight into orbital mechanics and mass distribution in galactic structures.
